# Fazaa

The First Project we had to do at RBK.

**The legend says that the team members still ==confused== as to what this App does ~!**

--- 
from what i remember this was supposed to be like a community uber; where i'm stranded and need a pick me up so i get on the app and see who is near, or if me and my neighbor have roughly the same raod to work so we go together or something. 

to do: 
- [ ] plan the models and their relations  
- [ ] redesign the server to utilize socket.io
- [ ] think of more todoes xD
